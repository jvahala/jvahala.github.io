## Hops: Beer's Nasal Gateway
The [Reinheitsgebot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot) of 1516, otherwise known as the "German Beer Purity Law", established the three (later four) ingredients that make up a beer: *water*, *barley*, and *hops* (and *yeast*). Beer has come a long way, and with globalization, we've gained access to ingriguing brews from all over the world. Many of these beers get their intrigue from the aromatic and fruity hops they use, but what gives these hops their character? 

To begin understanding the answer, I've crawled [YCH HOPS](https://ychhops.com/varieties). I couldn't find a more complete hop resource in my many googlings. For each hop of their website, they give typical ranges for qualities like "Alpha Acid %", "Beta Acid %", and "Total Oil". More interestingly, they provide additional resolution about what oils are in the hops along with the hop's key aromas (Citrus, Pine, Earthy, etc.). Maybe we can build an aroma classfier given the hop oils as features? 

## Data Details
The collected dataset includes 127 unique hops with counts: 

|      AROMA     | COUNT | PERCENT |
|:--------------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Citrus         |   54  |  42.51% |
| Herbal         |   48  |  37.80% |
| Spicy          |   48  |  37.80% |
| Floral         |   47  |  37.01% |
| Fruity         |   43  |  33.86% |
| Earthy         |   29  |  22.83% |
| Tropical Fruit |   16  |  12.60% |
| Pine           |   16  |  12.60% |
| Grassy         |   8   |  6.30%  |
| Cedar          |   7   |  5.51%  |
| Stone Fruit    |   6   |  4.72%  |
| Green          |   1   |  0.79%  |


## Data Extraction Process
More details to come. Basic process for getting individual hop data points boiled down to taking the average value of the hop oil ranges. An additional hop oil column *Unknown* was defined as whatever percent of the total oil is required to make all oil contributions sum to 100%. 

## Visualizations
Each visualization in this section is formed by one of three types of hops: Aroma, Bittering, or Dual-purpose (both Aroma and Bittering). Brewing typically involves a 60 minute "Boil" process, where you boil your "Wort" (pretty much sugar water, where the sugar has been extracted from the grains in the previous "Mash" step). During this process, you add the hops. If you add the hops early in the boil, then more of hop oils are isomerized and you get less aroma, but more bitterness from them. If you add hops late in the boil, then fewer hop oils are isomerized and you get more aroma, but less bitterness. The bitterness comes mainly from the Alpha Acid %. Bittering hops have high AA% values, and thus require smaller quantities to reach higher IBU values (say, for an IPA). Aroma hops have lower AA% values, and thus wouldn't be so economical to use in reaching a high IBU. Dual-purpose hops are somewhat in between. 

The x-axis of each visualization contains all of the aroma categories supplied by YCH HOPS. Many hops fall in more than one aroma category. Each column represents the mean value of each oil percentage or composition considering all hops in the category that contain that aroma profile.

## Next steps
Now that it seems like some characteristics can be determined by this data, it's time to build a classifier. I will try various ensemble and neural network approaches in a future post to see if we can get some reasonable classification going.
