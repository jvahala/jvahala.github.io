	<p>I'm currently a ECE graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison focusing in controls/optimization. I am also doing research related to modeling human-robot interactions during handover processes. I enjoy messing with electronics and employing optimization techniques to make things behave. See the <a href="/blog">blog</a> for various past projects. <a href="../">go home...</a></p>
