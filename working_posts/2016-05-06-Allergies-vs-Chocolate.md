I have a theory. I would like to test this theory. Please help. 

# Situation:

Assume you are picking a new life. You have all the experience from your previous life (i.e. your current life, assuming you are not of the undead). Your new life will be similar to your current life in all ways but one: you must select whether to *(a)* have allergies and enjoy chocolate, or to *(b)* have zero allergies but not enjoy chocolate. 

*VOTING BLOCK HERE*

## Allergy stipulations:

Your new allergy level will be determined by a uniform random variable from mild to severe, where this completely non-mathy 
scale is defined in Figure 1, with your expected allergy level as mild-severe. Severe means you should not get anywhere near
your allergen (for example, if one severe allergen were peanuts, then you could be killed by peanuts). 

*FIGURE 1 HERE*

You are not limited to a single allergen, but the effect of all your allergens and their random severities determine how severe your allergies are rated. See Figure 2 for the probability distribution of having a certain level of allergies.

*FIGURE 2 HERE*

There is a small chance that your allergen is something often found in chocolate (friends who say they are allergic to chocolate are lying fools, don't like chocolate, or aren't [pedantic](http://www.nyallergy.com/chocolate-allergy.php)), but I'll be nice and say your allergy would be similar to how dogs are affected by chocolate. That is, it will be dependent on your size. Here's a handy calculator to show what would happen to you if you were a dog who ate chocolate: 
[dog-simulator](http://www.petmd.com/dog/chocolate-toxicity). That would be a bummer. Here's an artist's rendition (Figure 3) of what it may be like to have the expected level of allergies, but enjoy chocolate. 

*FIGURE 3 HERE*


## Chocolate stipulations:

If you choose to be allergy-free but dislike chocolate, then this means you do not enjoy any type of chocolate and includes 
notes of chocolate found in your favorite stouts and coffees or other delicacies. If it's described as chocolate anything, you probably aren't allowed to like it in this scenario. I'm unclear on whether or not white chocolate counts, so feel free to tell me it does or does not in the queries below. Here's an artists rendition (Figure 4) of what it may be like to dislike chocolate but be allergy-free.
